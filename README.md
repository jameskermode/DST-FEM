GitHub repo at: https://github.com/jameskermode/DST-FEM/

This notebook is based on a lecture gives to the [Diamond Science and Technology (DST) CDT](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dst) at the University of Warwick in November 2017.

The [FEM-lecture.ipynb](FEM-lecture.ipynb) Jupyter notebook can be previewed from this Github repository directly, or run using [JuliaBox](https://www.juliabox.com). To run it using JuliaBox:

- Create an account and login
- From the "Sync" tab, choose "Git repository" and enter the following details:
   - Git Clone url: https://github.com/jameskermode/DST-FEM/
   - Branch: master
   - JuliaBox folder: DST-FEM
      
- When you return to the JuliaBox home page, you should see a `DST-FEM` folder with an `FEM-lecture.ipynb` notebook inside.
- Click the notebook to open it, then press `Shift+Enter` to execute code in each cell in turn.
