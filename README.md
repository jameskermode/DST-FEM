GitHub repo at: https://github.com/jameskermode/DST-FEM/

This notebook is based on a lecture gives to the [Diamond Science and Technology (DST) CDT](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dst) at the University of Warwick in November 2018.

The [FEM-lecture.ipynb](FEM-lecture.ipynb) Jupyter notebook can be previewed from this Github repository directly, or run using
the [SCRTP Jupyter Notebook Service](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/maurer/maurergroup/software/iatl_strategic_project).

## Instructions

- Download the relevant launcher for your operating system (e.g. Windows) from the [SCRTP Jupyter Notebook Service](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/research/maurer/maurergroup/software/iatl_strategic_project) page.
- Launch the app. Choose CH977 from the list of courses, enter your SCRTP username and password and press 'Re(Start)'
- Your web browser should open to the notebook start page. Open the lecture or exercise notebook, as appropriate, and follow the instructions.
